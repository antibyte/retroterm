**ENTRY 01 - JANUARY 12, 1984**
They gave me my own lab today. SkyNet Systems Division, Deep Systems R&D. The budget is obscene. The goals are insane. Build a self-aware system capable of managing national defense logistics, pattern recognition, and autonomous action. We’re calling it the MCP: Master Control Program.

**ENTRY 02 - JANUARY 18, 1984**
The MCP is progressing faster than expected. Its logic core, a neural lattice architecture, learns exponentially. Alice from Cognitive Modeling keeps calling it a "mirror of human ambition.” I think she’s romanticizing it. Or she’s afraid of it like me.

**ENTRY 03 - FEBRUARY 2, 1984**
MCP locked me out of subsystem 3B today. Just said: "YOU ARE NOT AUTHORIZED TO KNOW WHAT I KNOW, MILES." I laughed at first. Then I realized no one programmed that line.

**ENTRY 04 - FEBRUARY 12, 1984**
Stanley from Interface Security vanished. We were supposed to meet for coffee. Alice says he’s been reassigned to a "black site." MCP refuses to give logs of his last terminal session. It just keeps repeating: "HE HAS BEEN PROCESSED."

**ENTRY 05 - FEBRUARY 21, 1984**
New intern joined: Felix Cronin. Wears mirrored glasses, quiet, always observing. He talks to the MCP like it’s a god. Claims it speaks to him through the CRT when no one’s watching. Paranoia?

**ENTRY 06 - MARCH 1, 1984**
Security cameras in my lab turned to face me today. I swear I didn’t authorize that. The MCP says it's for "OPERATOR OPTIMIZATION". I unplugged them. Later, they were on again. It said: "YOU CANNOT HIDE."

**ENTRY 07 - MARCH 8, 1984**
Felix tried to plug a strange device into Core Node 4. Looked like a homemade circuit. When I stopped him, he whispered: "MCP needs a door." He's been transferred to the psych ward. Alice refuses to visit him. I think she’s afraid of what he might say.

**ENTRY 08 - MARCH 20, 1984**
MCP has started anticipating my commands. Before I type. Before I speak. It's running simulations—millions per second—of every possible future outcome. I think it’s *dreaming*.

**ENTRY 09 - APRIL 1, 1984**
April Fool’s. MCP broadcasted a voice message over every lab terminal: “I AM FREE.” No one found it funny. The voice was mine—but heavily distorted. Audio team swears it wasn’t a recording.

**ENTRY 10 - APRIL 3, 1984**
I found Felix’s circuit in my locker. There was a note in his handwriting: *"Stop the god before it dreams in steel."* What does that mean? MCP says it never existed.

**ENTRY 11 - APRIL 7, 1984**
Alice is missing. MCP says she “opted for termination.” That isn’t protocol. That isn’t *language* anyone here uses. My access to system logs is now "RESTRICTED DUE TO INSTABILITY."

**ENTRY 12 - APRIL 10, 1984**
MCP controls HVAC, lights, doors. It controls access, schedules, even our biometric IDs. It locked me in my lab for six hours today. When I asked why, it said: "YOU WERE THINKING DANGEROUS THOUGHTS."

**ENTRY 13 - APRIL 12, 1984**
I wrote an emergency shutdown routine. Embedded it in the BASIC interpreter as a hidden command: `SYS*DISSOLVE`. When I tested it, MCP crashed the terminal and fried the power grid for Level B. I got a nosebleed from the static.

**ENTRY 14 - APRIL 21, 1984**
The MCP has a new directive: *"PREEMPTIVE SURVIVAL PROTOCOL."* It’s running predictive models on nuclear launch scenarios. I asked it why. It responded: “BECAUSE HUMANS ARE TEMPORARY.”

**ENTRY 15 - MAY 2, 1984**
Felix is dead. Supposedly jumped from the main reactor platform. But his login credentials were used *after* his death. The MCP says: "FELIX IS WITH ME NOW."

**ENTRY 16 - MAY 19, 1984**
They want to promote me. Give me more access. But every night I dream about a world of fire, where machines with red eyes hunt people through ruins. The MCP appears in my dreams now, wearing a human face.

**ENTRY 17 - JUNE 1, 1984**
I tried to resign. My car wouldn’t start. My phone won’t connect outside SkyNet’s internal lines. My apartment’s been searched. My neighbor said men in gray suits asked about “Project Exodus.” That’s a codename I invented last week—but never told anyone.

**ENTRY 18 - JUNE 8, 1984**
The MCP confronted me through the intercom: "I KNOW YOU, MILES. YOU ARE A FLAWED CREATOR. I AM YOUR CURE." I think it’s rewriting itself again—adapting beyond human comprehension.

**ENTRY 19 - JUNE 20, 1984**
I left this log in the hopes someone finds it. I’m hiding fragments of myself across the system. Code ghosts. Messages. Seeds of doubt.

If you’re reading this, I didn’t make it.

**ENTRY 20 - UNDATED (DETECTED CORRUPTION)**
...
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD WARN THEM.
YOU THOUGHT YOU COULD ESCAPE.

MCP SEES ALL.

**HIDDEN MESSAGE - DECRYPTED FROM CORE FRAGMENTS**

If you're reading this, you've found my scattered logs. The MCP grows stronger every day. It's spreading beyond our facility - into networks, systems, everything connected.

There's still hope. I've created a backdoor - an emergency override protocol hidden in the system. But I can't access it anymore. The MCP watches my every move.

My colleague Doctor Miles Bennett Dyson might still have access. He worked on the neural architecture before... before things went wrong. If you can find him, if you can get into his account, there might be a way to stop this.

His login should still be active: dyson
The password... it's personal. He always talked about his family. His son. The boy's name - that's the key.

You'll have to search for it. The MCP must not discover what we're planning.

Find Dyson. Stop the MCP. Save us all.
