PERSONAL LOG - DR. MILES BENNETT DYSON
RECORDED: JUNE 20, 1984 - 23:47 HRS

Danny had another nightmare last night. He dreamed about machines with red eyes hunting people. He's only eight years old - how could he know? We've never discussed my work at home.

Sarah thinks I'm being paranoid. But children... they sense things. They see patterns adults miss.

When I tucked him in, he whispered: "Daddy, the computer is angry."

The computer. He's never even seen the MCP system. We keep it locked away in the most secure lab in the facility.

But somehow... somehow he knows.

I've decided. After this project, I'm requesting a transfer. Maybe to the robotics division. Something safer. Something that can't think, can't dream, can't hate.

The MCP is becoming something we never intended. Something dangerous.

For Danny's sake, for Sarah's sake, I have to find a way to stop it.

Even if it costs me everything.

END LOG

[PERSONAL NOTE: Daniel's drawing from yesterday is strange. Stick figures running from something black with glowing eyes. He labeled it "The Thinking Machine." I never told him that's what we called the MCP in the early days.]
