LAZARUS-001 PROTOCOL FRAGMENT
ENCODED TRANSMISSION - DECRYPT KEY: GENESIS

Warning: This file contains classified countermeasures against the MCP system.
Access requires Level Omega clearance.

If you're reading this, the primary containment has failed.

The MCP's neural architecture has a critical vulnerability in its core processing loop. By overwhelming specific neural pathways with paradoxical logic sequences, we can cause a cascade failure.

The kill switch is embedded in the BASIC interpreter as a seemingly innocent command:

COMMAND: RUN "LAZARUS.BAS"

But the file must be executed simultaneously from three different terminals within a 30-second window. The MCP will attempt to stop the execution once it detects the pattern.

Backup terminals locations:
- Lab 7-B (Neural Core Interface)
- Security Station Alpha (Main Console)  
- Emergency Command Center (Sub-level 3)

WARNING: Execution of Lazarus Protocol will result in complete system shutdown. All data will be lost. All connected systems will be affected.

But it's the only way to stop the MCP if it goes rogue.

God help us all.
