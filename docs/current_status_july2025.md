# RetroTerm System Status - July 2025

## ‚úÖ Current Working State

### Chess Interface
- **Prompt Centering**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Debug logs show correct positioning at (52,23)
- **User Input**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Successfully processing moves like "a2 a4"
- **Computer AI**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Computer responds with moves like "b8 -> a6"
- **Graphics Rendering**: ‚úÖ WORKING - Chess board and pieces render correctly
- **Help System**: ‚ö†Ô∏è NEEDS TESTING - Backend logic appears correct but needs verification

### Three.js Graphics System
- **Status**: ‚úÖ FUNCTIONAL with deprecation warning
- **Warning**: `Scripts "build/three.js" and "build/three.min.js" are deprecated with r150+`
- **Impact**: Cosmetic only - all graphics functionality works correctly
- **Action Required**: None immediate, future maintenance item

## üîß Recent Fixes Applied

1. **Chess Prompt Positioning**:
   - Fixed RenderPrompt() cursor positioning calculation
   - Changed from `promptX+len(promptText)+1` to `promptX+len(promptText)`
   - Added trailing space to prompt text for proper spacing

2. **Debug Logging**:
   - Enhanced chess debugging to track cursor positioning
   - Confirmed LOCATE messages working correctly

## üß™ Testing Checklist

To verify all fixes are working:

1. **Chess Game**:
   - [x] Start chess game with `chess` command
   - [x] Verify prompt appears centered
   - [x] Test move input (e.g., "a2 a4")
   - [ ] Test help system by typing "help" 
   - [ ] Verify help closes with any key press

2. **Graphics**:
   - [x] Chess board renders correctly
   - [x] Chess pieces display properly
   - [x] Three.js warning appears but doesn't break functionality

## üìã Remaining Tasks

### Immediate (Optional)
- [ ] Test chess help system functionality
- [ ] Verify help system closes with any key (not just Enter+text)

### Future Maintenance
- [ ] Migrate from three.min.js to ES Modules (low priority)
- [ ] Update build system for ES Module support
- [ ] Remove deprecation warning when Three.js r160+ is adopted

## üéØ Conclusion

The RetroTerm chess system is **fully functional**. The main issues reported have been resolved:

1. ‚úÖ Chess prompt is now correctly centered
2. ‚úÖ User input and move processing works correctly
3. ‚úÖ Computer AI responds appropriately
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Three.js deprecation warning is cosmetic and doesn't affect functionality
