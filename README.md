Try it here : https://retroterm.de

A browser based retro terminal with a backend written in go.

This thing was created as an *experiment* to create a project using only AI as coder.

Thus 99% of the code was created by various models of Github Copilot.
(That was a nightmare !)

The frontend creates a Green Monitor used as a terminal.
All computation is handled in the backend.

Features :
Guests and logged in users.

Guests have a virtual filesystem in ram (gets lost), users get one in the sqlite database.

Virtual OS with some commands

Basic Interpreter with AI coding help: "mcp create a graphical sine wave that moves"

A chat application with a very special 80's personality connected to the Deepseek API

SAM speech synthesizer and SID player usable in Basic

Basic has some sound, sprite, graphics and vectorgraphics commands
